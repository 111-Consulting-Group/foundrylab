      # CRITICAL: The following environment variables MUST be set in Render dashboard
      # BEFORE the first deployment. They are required at BUILD TIME:
      # - EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (your Supabase project URL)
      # - EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (your Supabase anon/public key)
      # These are baked into the static build during the build phase
